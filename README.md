# Scientific Calculator Web App

This is a simple yet functional scientific calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations as well as more advanced scientific calculations.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).
*   **Power/Exponentiation:**  Supports raising numbers to a power using the `^` symbol (e.g., `2^3` for 2 cubed).
*   **Square Root:** Calculates the square root of a number using the `√` symbol.
*   **Factorial:** Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using the `!` symbol (e.g., `5!` for factorial of 5).
*   **Square Function:** Calculates the square of a number using the `number^2` notation.
*   **Trigonometric Functions:** Includes sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), and tangent (`tan`) functions (in radians).
*   **Logarithmic Functions:** Supports base-10 logarithm (`log`) and natural logarithm (`ln`).
*   **Constants:** Includes mathematical constants pi (`π`) and Euler's number (`e`).
*   **Parentheses:** Allows the use of parentheses `()` to control the order of operations.
*   **Clear and Delete:** Provides a "C" button to clear the entire display and a "DEL" button to delete the last entered character.
*   **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" if an invalid operation is attempted (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Use the buttons on the calculator to enter numbers and operators.
3.  For scientific functions, use the following notations:
    *   Square: `number^2` (e.g., `5^2`)
    *   Power: `base^exponent` (e.g., `2^3`)
    *   Square root: `√number` (e.g., `√9`)
    *   Factorial: `number!` (e.g., `5!`)
    *   Sine: `sin(number)`
    *   Cosine: `cos(number)`
    *   Tangent: `tan(number)`
    *   Logarithm (base 10): `log(number)`
    *   Natural logarithm: `ln(number)`
    *   Pi: `π`
    *   Euler's number: `e`
4.  Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
